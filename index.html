    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>I am an Assistant Professor in Electrical Power Systems at the <a title="" href="https://www.ucd.ie/eece/">School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering</a>
    at University College Dublin. My background includes interdisciplinary education in energy engineering and economics and a multi-year research track on electric power systems across several European Universities. </p>  
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <p>My research lies at the intersection of cyber-physical electric power systems, stochastic optimisation and emerging approaches—ranging from  AI-based decision support to quantum computing.  I am particularly interested in developing solutions that balance academic rigor, novelty and real-world applicability,  leveraging synergies between advanced theory and domain-specific expertise.</p>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <p>I view teaching and student mentorship as an opportunity to support students in developing both technical expertise and confidence in their own voice as emerging professionals. I strive to create an inclusive and engaging learning environment where students are encouraged to ask questions, challenge assumptions, and connect theory with real-world practice.</p>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <p>I actively engage in international collaborations and contribute to expert working groups that address pressing challenges in the energy sector. Beyond research, I value the role of academic service and regularly volunteer my time in peer review, technical committees, and mentoring activities that support the broader engineering and scientific community. </p>
